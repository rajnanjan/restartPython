# what is indentation ?
# --> Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
# --> where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
# --> Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code
# --> Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
if(True):
 print("start learing")
 print("outside of the condition")
# --> You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
if(True):
    print("block spaces --- in python")
    print("block spaces --- in pythone")
